## 1. Introduction
In Temuco, pet adoption and temporary fostering systems are highly fragmented. Most coordination currently takes place through disconnected social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram, which makes the process unreliable and difficult to manage. Moreover, there is no official platform where people can consistently publish or search for pets in need. This app seeks to address both of these problems by providing a central, trustworthy hub for adoption and fostering.

## 3. Strategy
The first step under the Elements of User Experience is the Strategy plane, which focuses on incorporating not only what the people running the application want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the application.

From this aproach, a Value Proposition Canvas is used to determined what the people wants to earn from our solution and how are we gonna respond to those needs.

## 4. Solutions Scope

Defining the solution's scope is crucial to ensure the design remains focused on the problems identified in the strategy. PetConnect will primarily focus on two key functionalities: centralizing the posting and searching for lost pets and streamlining the process of pet adoption and temporary fostering within the commune of Temuco. This means the application must provide a robust profile system, simplified forms for publishing alerts and adoptions, and clear navigation that directs users to their desired action (whether it is Finding a pet or Posting about one). Development will be limited to these core functionalities to guarantee a reliable user experience before considering any future expansions.

## 5. Benchmark

To develop a solution that truly meets user expectations and rises above the existing chaotic landscape in Temuco, an exhaustive competitive analysis, or benchmarking, is essential. This process involves thoroughly examining current apps and platforms—especially those focused on lost pets and adoption—to identify their crucial strengths and significant shortcomings. By learning from competitors' successful features, we can integrate proven functionalities into PetConnect while strategically avoiding their design or process flaws. This objective perspective will ensure our application is not only reliable but also offers a superior, market-aligned user experience that directly addresses the fragmented systems our users currently face.
